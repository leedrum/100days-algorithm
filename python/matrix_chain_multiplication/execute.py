# algorithm: matrix chain multiplication

# Matrix multiplication is an associative operation. (AB)C is equal to A(BC) for matrices A, B, C,
# and it doesn’t matter which order of pair multiplication you choose.

# Unfortunately, that’s not true from computational perspective. If dimensions of matrices are A=[10, 20], B=[20, 30], C=[30, 40],
# numbers of scalar multiplications differ significantly:

# (AB)C = 10*20*30 + 10*30*40 = 18000
# A(BC) = 20*30*40 + 10*20*40 = 32000

# The best ordering can be found using recursive relationship.
# Let MCM denotes a function that returns a minimum number of scalar multiplications.
# Then MCM can be defined as the best split among all possible choices.

# O(n^3) time complexity
def mult(chain):
    n = len(chain)

    # single matrix chain has zero cost
    aux = {(i, i): (0,) + chain[i] for i in range(n)}

    # i: length of subchain
    for i in range(1, n):
        # j: starting index of subchain
        for j in range(0, n - i):
            best = float('inf')

            # k: splitting point of subchain
            for k in range(j, j + i):
                # multiply subchains at splitting point
                lcost, lname, lrow, lcol = aux[j, k]
                rcost, rname, rrow, rcol = aux[k + 1, j + i]
                cost = lcost + rcost + lrow * lcol * rcol
                var = '(%s%s)' % (lname, rname)

                # pick the best one
                if cost < best:
                    best = cost
                    aux[j, j + i] = cost, var, lrow, rcol

    return dict(zip(['cost', 'order', 'rows', 'cols'], aux[0, n - 1]))
