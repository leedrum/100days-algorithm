# Hanoi Tower algorithm

- **Mission**
  - We have 3 rods and we must move the tower from the 1st rod to the 3rd rod.

- **Conditions**:
  - Only one disk may be moved at a time.

  - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.

  - No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
